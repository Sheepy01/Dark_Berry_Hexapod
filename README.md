# 🕷️ Darkberry Hexapod Project

**Darkberry** is a six-legged robotic spider built using a **Raspberry Pi** and a **DualShock 4 (DS4) controller**.  
It combines **robotics, computer vision, and AI** to simulate the natural movements and behaviors of a real spider.  
The goal is to create an autonomous hexapod capable of **environmental analysis, object detection, and self-navigation** without human control.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Darkberry is designed to move and act like a living organism — capable of walking, turning, performing gestures, and streaming live visuals.  
In its early phase, it was remotely controlled using a PS4 controller. The ongoing development aims to give it **independent intelligence** using onboard sensors and AI models.

### Key Features
- 🦿 **6-Leg Walking Mechanism** – Smooth, stable gait controlled via servo motors.
- 🎮 **DS4 Controller Support** – Manual control for walking, turning, and gestures.
- 📷 **Camera Integration** – Capture photos and videos through the Raspberry Pi camera.
- 🧭 **Sensor Fusion (planned)** – For obstacle detection and autonomous pathfinding.
- 🧠 **AI Integration (in progress)** – Object recognition, decision-making, and behavior patterns.
- 🔋 **Portable Design** – Powered by Li-ion battery pack for untethered operation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/darkberry-hexapod.git
cd darkberry-hexapod
2. Install Dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip python3-opencv
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685 pygame flask

3. Connect Hardware

Connect all 18 servos to PCA9685.

Connect PCA9685 to Raspberry Pi GPIO (SDA, SCL, VCC, GND).

Pair the DualShock 4 controller via Bluetooth.

4. Run the Controller Script

🧠 Future Goals

 Integrate ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors for environment mapping.

 Develop AI-based obstacle avoidance using computer vision.

 Implement gait optimization using reinforcement learning.

 Add spider-like behavior simulation (e.g., hunting, reacting to movement).

 Design a web dashboard for monitoring and controlling the robot remotely.
